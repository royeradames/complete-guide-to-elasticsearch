# Search methods

## DSL queries

### Long
```JSON
GET product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": {
        "value": "red wine"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Short version (because we don't configure the query)

```JSON
GET product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description": "red wine"
    }
  }
}
```

### supports cruise string queries

```JSON
GET product/_search
{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "name:pasta"
    }
  }
}
```

## Request URI (Cruise string queries)

`GET product/_search?q=name:pasta`

Has limitations.
Great for terminals.

# Searching with the request URI

```JSON
#returning everything
GET products/_search?q=*

# search by field
# <field name>:<value>
GET products/_search?q=name:lobster

# array of field
GET products/_search?q=tags:Meat 

# Multiple fields
# in terminal you need to do %20 instead of white space
GET products/_search?q=tags:Meat and name:tuna
```
