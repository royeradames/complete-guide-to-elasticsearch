# Introudction to compound queries

![leaf vs compound queries](pictures/8.adding-boolean-logic-to-queries/leaf-vs-compound-query.png)

Compound queries wraps leaf queries or more compound queries into a single operation.

# Querying with boolean logic

- Like the where clause in sql + deals with _score and score boosting. boost their brain development
- Can be use with the query or filter context
- Array is not needed if you only have 1 input
- The score from each matching must or should clause will be**added together to provide the final _score**for each document.

- Fields
  - must:
    - require to match all fields given, and rank by how well it matches.
    - Give range query a score of 1 by default
  - filter:
    - For the fields match or not
    - Can be catch
  - should:
    - boost score if they match but not require.
    - Great field to define preferences.
    - If there is no must or filter, at least 1 is require
  - must_not:
    - executed in the filter context
    - scoring is ignore and score of 0 is return for all matching docs
    - Queries are consider for catching

## Matched_queries will have all the queries that it matches

Making it easier to see why it score so high.

Higher score will have most names

```JSON
"matched_queries" : [
  "parmesan_must",
  "preparation_time_minutes_filter",
  "parsley_should"
]
```

Lower score will have less.

```JSON
"matched_queries" : [
  "parmesan_must",
  "preparation_time_minutes_filter"
]
```
