# Flexible matching with the match query

- all words need to be present but other doesn't matter and there can be extra words
- because we are searching by the terms not a whole sentence

```JSON
# uses or operator for the input after its analyze
GET recipe/_search
{
  "explain": true, 
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": "Recipes with pasta or spaghetti"
    }
  }
}

# use and operator
# all words need to be present but other doesn't matter and there can be extra words
# because we are searching by the terms not a whole sentence
GET recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "Recipes with pasta or spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}

GET recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta or spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}

GET recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "title": {
        "query": "pasta spaghetti",
        "operator": "and"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Operator

[reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query.html)
(Optional, string) Boolean logic used to interpret text in the query value. Valid values are:

### OR (Default)

For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted as capital
OR of OR Hungary.
### AND

For example, a query value of capital of Hungary is interpreted as capital
AND of AND Hungary.

## match vs term

term doesn't analyze the input
match runs the analyzer and uses the output to match the inverted indexes

# Matching phrases

the order of the term matters.

```JSON
# the order of the term matters
# you get a result
GET recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "spaghetti puttanesca"
    }
  }
}

# you don't get a result
GET recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match_phrase": {
      "title": "puttanesca spaghetti"
    }
  }
}
```

# Searching multiple fields

Search multiple fields at the same time for a single text.

```JSON
GET recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "pasta",
      "fields": ["title", "description"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Fields can be specified with wildcards:

```JSON
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":    "Will Smith",
      "fields": [ "title", "*_name" ] 
    }
  }
}
```

## Individual fields can be boosed with caret (^) notation
```JSON
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query" : "this is a test",
      "fields" : [ "subject^3", "message" ] 
    }
  }
}
```

## Types of multi_match query

[reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#multi-match-types)

It's also possible to add a type option to the query to control how the query is executed internally. That gets a bit more advanced.

| Name            | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `best_fields`   | (default) Finds documents which match any field, but uses the _score from the best field. [See best_fields. ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-best-fields)                  |
| `most_fields`   | Finds documents which match any field and combines the _score from each field. [See most_fields.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-most-fields)                              |
| `cross_fields`  | Treats fields with the same analyzer as though they were one big field. Looks for each word in any field. [See cross_fields.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-cross-fields) |
| `phrase`        | Runs a match_phrase query on each field and uses the _score from the best field. [See phrase and phrase_prefix.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-phrase)                    |
| `phrase_prefix` | Runs a match_phrase_prefix query on each field and uses the _score from the best field. [See phrase and phrase_prefix. ](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-phrase)            |
| `bool_prefix`   | Creates a match_bool_prefix query on each field and combines the _score from each field. [See bool_prefix](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-multi-match-query.html#type-bool-prefix).                    |

```JSON
GET /_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match" : {
      "query":      "quick brown f",
      "type":       "bool_prefix",
      "fields":     [ "subject", "message" ]
    }
  }
}
```

## How things work in the background

Suppose that we are searching for the term spaghetti and pasta with the title and description fields. Even though we're searching two fields, a document would probably be more relevant if the two terms

appeared in the same field instead of one term in each field. By default, documents containing the terms in any of the specified fields are matched, but the relevant score from the best matching field is used.

This means that if one of the fields contains both terms and the other fields only contains one of them, then the relevant score for the first field is used for that document.What happens internally is that ElasticSearch takes the terms and executes a match query for each one within a query named **Dismukes**. That's an advance query.

# Assignment 2: Full text queries

```JSON
#Please write a query searching for the sentence "pasta with parmesan and spinach" within the "title" field, simulating that this sentence was entered by a user within a search field.
GET recipe/_search
{

      "title": "pasta with parmesan and spinach"
    }
  }
}

# Please write a query searching for phrase "pasta carbonara" within the "title" field.
GET recipe/_search
